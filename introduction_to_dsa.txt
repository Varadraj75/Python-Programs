Time complexity:- BIG O notation O() (o is capital ) and () is for the realtion
    it says how number of input varies the time taken by the program.

1. Constant time complexity O(1):- number of input doesn't depend on execusion time  , always the work remain same , always realtion between the input and output remains same 
for example:- program:- 
                        n=int("Enter the input")
                         print(n)
these is O(1) notation

2. Linear time complexity O(n):- 
we have to go to each any every element one time in the iteration , visit everyone

3. Quadratic time complexity O(n^2): 
each and every element has to visit other element 

4. logarthmic time complexity O(log n):



constant >> logarthmic >> linear >> Quadratic
