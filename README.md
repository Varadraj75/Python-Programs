# Python Programs

This repository is a structured collection of Python scripts covering fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and small practical projects. It serves as a learning reference for beginners as well as students preparing for coding interviews or aiming to strengthen their Python foundations.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide clean, easy-to-understand Python programs that demonstrate:

- Core Python syntax and programming concepts  
- Data Structures & Algorithms with clear implementations  
- Practical scripts and mini-projects to apply logic  
- Progressive learning — from basic programs to more structured, modular code  

Each file is self-contained, readable, and suitable for both learning and revision.

## Contents

### 1. Python Fundamentals  
Scripts demonstrating essential Python concepts such as:  
- Variables, data types, operators  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Functions and scope  
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- String operations  
- File handling and exceptions  
These scripts help build a strong foundation in Python programming.

### 2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)  
Well-structured implementations of commonly used algorithms and data structures including:  
- Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search  
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc.  
- Array and list manipulation techniques  
- Basic linked list operations (where included)  
These programs focus on logic clarity, step-by-step progression, and interview-oriented thinking.

### 3. Practice Problems & Logical Programs  
A collection of logic-oriented Python programs aimed at improving problem-solving skills, such as:  
- Pattern printing  
- Mathematical utilities  
- String/number manipulations  
- Input-based small tasks  
These help sharpen logical reasoning and coding fluency.

### 4. Mini-Projects  
Small but functional Python scripts built to demonstrate real-world application of programming concepts, including:  
- Calculator programs  
- ATM simulation  
- Attendance or student-record based logic  
- QR code generator (if present)  
These projects combine multiple programming concepts into cohesive scripts.

## Usage
