## Python Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python scripts covering basic programming concepts (input/output, conditionals, loops, functions, simple games, and small utilities). It is suitable for learners practicing Python fundamentals and for contributors making incremental improvements.

### Structure
- `Python-Programs/`: Individual standalone scripts. Many are interactive and can be run directly with Python 3.

### How to Run
Use Python 3.10+.

Run any script from the project root or from within the `Python-Programs` directory, for example:

```bash
cd Python-Programs
python3 "Basic Calculator Operartion.py"
```

Some scripts accept command-line arguments. For example, the workout timer:

```bash
python3 "Workout Timer.py" --seconds 10
```

### Recently Improved Scripts
- `Basic Calculator Operartion.py`: Refactored into reusable functions with input validation and an optional CLI.
- `rock-paper-scissors.py`: Fixed game loop, added input validation, replay support, and clearer prompts.
- `Workout Timer.py`: Added `argparse` support, countdown behavior with one-second intervals, and clearer output.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Ideas:
- Improve input validation and error handling in scripts
- Add documentation or usage examples to script headers
- Convert interactive scripts to also support command-line flags via `argparse`
- Add small, self-contained new programs demonstrating Python basics

Please keep changes focused and well-documented. For any script you modify, try to:
- Preserve existing behavior where reasonable
- Add helpful prompts and messages
- Guard execution with `if __name__ == "__main__":` when adding functions
